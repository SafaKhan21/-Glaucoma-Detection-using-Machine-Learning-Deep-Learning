# 🧠 Glaucoma Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **retinal image classification** to distinguish between **Healthy** and **Glaucoma** cases.  
It combines **traditional machine learning approaches** with **deep learning models** to evaluate and compare performance.

## 🔹 Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Image renaming and dataset organization
   - Resizing and normalization  
   
2. **Feature Extraction**
   - HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)  
   - LBP (Local Binary Pattern)  
   - ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)  
   - Combined feature vectors for ML models  

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  

4. **Deep Learning (CNN)**
   - Convolutional Neural Network implemented with and without **Dropout**  
   - Comparison of overfitting and generalization  

## 📊 Results
- Traditional ML models provided reasonable performance  
- **CNN with Dropout** achieved the best results, with ~90% accuracy and balanced precision/recall  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
